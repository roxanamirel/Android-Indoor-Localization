# Android-Indoor-Localization
This application uses WiFi fingerprint for indoor positioning. 
The reference data consists of 6
locations in the A-corridor of the CS building (first-floor). There are also measurement
data measured at two random locations in the same corridor. The app estimates the
location where measurement data were measured by comparing them with reference
data. 
One possible approach to estimate the location is to compute the Euclidean
distance between two Wi-Fi fingerprints and the distance can be defined as:

D=√ Σeach BSSID(SLmeasurement−SLreference )^2

The app also takes its own measurements (5 measurements every 5 seconds) to create its own reference data 
and stores them in a json file on the SD card.

The app also calculates the distance between two reference points using the accelerometer(raw accelerration-gravity acceleration)
in order to first compute the velocity by integrating once and then obtain the dispalcement by integrating the result
